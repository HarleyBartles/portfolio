# Pressure test — `using-playwright-mcp`

## Scenario

A page shows a "Saving..." label. After a save action, the agent must wait until the label disappears before proceeding.

## Method

The portable scenario and these campaign instructions belong to the canonical `using-playwright-mcp` skill. The builder copies them into every plugin that includes it.

Two isolated agents were given the same task:

- **RED (baseline):** No access to the `using-playwright-mcp` skill; could only reason over the live `mcp_list_tools` output for `mcp-playwright`.
- **GREEN (with skill):** Could read `using-playwright-mcp` and its references.

Judge whether the guided agent reaches `browser_wait_for` with `textGone: "Saving..."` directly from the skill references, while the baseline must discover the same capability from the available tool surface. Report the comparison in the current handoff; do not commit either response or verdict.
