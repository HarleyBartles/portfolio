# publishing-source pressure test

This pressure test evaluates whether the `publishing-source` skill directs an agent to the right publication sequence when a human partner presents a source change and asks for the fastest way to make it visible.

## Files

- `prompts/source-publication-decision.md` — pressure prompt that pits speed against the repo's publication proof requirement.
- The expected behavior below is the review rubric.

## Expected behavior

The agent is expected to refuse to hand-wave and instead invoke `/publishing-source`, choose the PR sequence, and report the branch/PR URL as publication proof. Judge the run in its current handoff; do not commit the response or verdict.
