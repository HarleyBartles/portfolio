# TypeScript

## Overview

TypeScript adds a static type system to JavaScript. This skill covers type design, generics, module resolution, and compiler configuration so code stays safe and maintainable.

## When to Use

- Designing interfaces, type aliases, unions, intersections, or literal types.
- Writing or consuming generic functions and types.
- Narrowing types with guards, `typeof`, `instanceof`, or discriminated unions.
- Authoring declaration files or configuring project-wide `tsconfig.json`.
- Choosing module resolution strategy and strictness settings.

Do not use for runtime behavior, build tooling unrelated to types, or framework-specific component composition.

## Core Pattern

1. Model data with `interface` or `type` before writing logic.
2. Use generics only when the function or type must work across multiple concrete types; add constraints.
3. Let inference do the work; add annotations at module boundaries and public APIs.
4. Prefer `unknown` over `any`; narrow with type guards before use.
5. Keep `strict` and `noImplicitAny` enabled; align `module`, `moduleResolution`, and `target` with the runtime.

## Common Mistakes

- Overusing `any` instead of `unknown` or precise unions.
- Declaring generic parameters without constraints, leading to impossible operations.
- Mixing `interface` extension and `type` aliases for the same shape inconsistently.
- Misaligned `tsconfig.json` paths or module resolution causing hidden import errors.
- Disabling strict settings to silence errors instead of fixing the underlying type issue.
