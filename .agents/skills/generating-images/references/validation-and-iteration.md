# Validation and iteration

Validation asks whether the returned media performs the approved story and
technical contract. It is not a claim that a generator's output is correct merely
because a file exists.

## Inspect at two scales

At full-frame scale, check:

- the intended first read and attention path;
- crop, scale, viewpoint, perspective, layer order, and negative space;
- subject/action, story beat, lighting, palette, and mood;
- whether the image survives its intended page, screen, or game placement.

At detail scale, check:

- face, hands, eyes, silhouettes, edges, and occlusions;
- text, logos, fine marks, texture, and repeated patterns;
- mask boundaries, alpha, contact shadows, reflections, and light continuity;
- artefacts that become visible at the delivered size or crop.

Also inspect the returned file rather than the requested contract:

- actual width, height, and aspect ratio;
- actual colour mode and alpha values;
- whether exact text and marks survived;
- whether a requested hex appears exactly or only approximately;
- whether one call returned the expected number of artifacts;
- whether every reference contributed only its assigned role.

If the image is intended for a responsive interface or a tile-sized game asset,
inspect at those actual presentation sizes as well as the source resolution.

## Comparison record

For each candidate, record:

```text
Candidate: <stable label>
Direction checked: <brief/version>
Capability/operation: <recorded route>
Passes: <specific invariants and story functions satisfied>
Defects: <specific observable failures>
Severity: blocking | material | polish
Disposition: selected | revise | rejected
```

“Looks good” is not enough. Name the evidence: “reserved right-third copy field
remains quiet at 390px crop” or “left eye and hand are readable at delivered size.”

Do not let numeric difference overrule perceptual evidence or vice versa. Report
both when they answer different contracts: a constrained regeneration can have low
pixel identity and still be visually indistinguishable, while a visually plausible
wordmark can contain zero exact brand-colour pixels.

## Iterate narrowly

1. Select the highest-severity material defect.
2. Change one prompt, input, mask, or provider parameter that could plausibly fix
   that defect. Keep all unrelated invariants repeated.
3. Generate a comparable result with the same operation and inputs.
4. Re-run full-frame and detail inspection; record whether the defect moved,
   cleared, or introduced a regression.
5. Stop when the asset is selected, the capability cannot satisfy the lock, or the
   brief needs a creative decision.

Do not pile fixes into one vague “make it better” iteration. Do not keep a long
series of incomparable variants and call the last one progress.

## Failure and stopping rules

- If the result never existed, report `blocked by missing capability`; do not
  report a path, preview, or success.
- If media exists but a hard invariant fails, report `generated but unresolved`
  with the failed invariant and last candidate location.
- If a required creative choice is missing, report `not generated because the
  brief is incomplete` and route the question to `directing-visual-stories`.
- If all hard requirements pass and custody evidence is complete, report `selected
  and handed off`.

Stop after a bounded number of targeted iterations when the same defect persists.
Escalate the capability limitation or revise the direction; do not weaken the
acceptance bar silently.
