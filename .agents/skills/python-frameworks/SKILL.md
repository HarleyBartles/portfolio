# Python Frameworks

Use this skill when choosing or applying Python web and task-queue frameworks.

## When to Use

- Building or reviewing Django applications.
- Designing FastAPI APIs and services.
- Adding Celery background tasks or scheduled jobs.
- Choosing among Django, FastAPI, and Celery for a component.

## Core Pattern

1. Choose Django for full-stack server-rendered or admin-heavy applications that need an ORM, migrations, and batteries-included conventions.
2. Choose FastAPI for API-first services that benefit from async endpoints, automatic OpenAPI docs, and Pydantic validation.
3. Use Celery to offload work to background workers when the response path must stay fast; broker with Redis or RabbitMQ and use result backends only when callers need results.
4. Keep framework code decoupled from business rules; put domain logic in services, models, or repositories and call it from views or tasks.
5. Test at the framework boundary with the FastAPI `TestClient` or Django test client; unit-test domain logic without loading the framework.

## Common Mistakes

- Putting business logic directly in views or tasks. → Move it to services or domain modules.
- Using Celery for synchronous, latency-sensitive work. → Keep real-time work in the request path or use async APIs.
- Mixing sync and async ORM calls in FastAPI. → Use async engines and sessions or route sync calls through executors.
- Ignoring Django migrations in tests. → Run migrations and use fixtures that reflect schema state.
